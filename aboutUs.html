    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        The <b>Standford Junior University</b> is made up of <b>43 constituent colleges,</b>
        consisting of 36 semi-autonomous colleges, four permanent private halls
        and three societies (colleges that are departments of the university,
        without their own royal charter), and a range of academic
        departments which are organised into four divisions. Each college
        is a self-governing institution within the university, controlling its
        own membership and having its own internal structure and activities.

            All students are members of a college. The university does not have
            a main campus, but its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout
            the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Standfor Junior University consists
            of lectures, small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls, seminars,
            laboratory workand occasionally further tutorials provided by the central
            universityfaculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided in a
            predominantly centralised fashion.
